TEMPORAL FRONTEND
let the odyssey begin..

How to get this project working:

## setup some dependencies:
NOTE: I know this is hairy; I will do my best to eliminate some of these steps...
- it will be extremely useful to have the SBT jar downloaded, and a script in your environment to execute it (version 0.11.2 is recommended)  go here for directions: https://github.com/harrah/xsbt/wiki/Getting-Started-Setup, look under "Installing sbt"
- SBT is INCLUDED in the project to make building and running easy (it is version 0.11.2 for the curious)
- the project has been adapted from the lift-bootstrap github project (https://github.com/fbettag)
   -- you MUST clone the author's other project located at https://github.com/fbettag/lift-bhtml, do a 'sbt publish-local' 
- the project uses the Highcharts-with-Scala github project to generate graphs
   -- you MUST clone this project and perform a 'sbt publish-local' within the project's directory
- unsurprisingly, Galago 3.2 is another dependency that must be checked out from it's Sourceforge location
   -- get Galago, do a 'mvn install' or 'mvn package' (not sure which one actually publishes it to the local repo) 
- ALL other dependencies specified in the build.sbt file should be auto-downloaded upon invoking './sbt' for the first time!

## for the query-word frequency demo:
- on laguna there is a 50k document index at /usr/lag/work1/allan/lgiorda
- in that dir, run 'galago search --index=./50k.index --corpus=./50k.index/corpus --port=9900
   -- note that the port NEEDS to be at 9900 for now since it's hardcoded into the website code
- ideally we'd be using the Pontos (c) distributed arch to search indexes


## for the verb/subj/obj frequency demo:
- the info displayed is currently housed in a mongodb instance out on armadale.cs.umass.edu (armadale.cs.umass.edu:28017 to verify it's working)
  -- the mongodb is located at /hdfs/disk2/lgiorda/data
  -- the class that calls methods on this DB is located in code.lib.Mongo

## RUNNING
clone and cd into the project directory
run './sbt' (using the "./" since we want to use the sbt located in the project)
run 'container:start' to fire up an instance of the site running at your localhost:8082

most of all, enjoy.
