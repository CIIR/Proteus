Example scripts used to build various parts of the index. They can all be run
independently, although obviously they should all point at the same input 
source.

allJobs.json can be called with 'chain-jobs' to run the entire pipeline
(all 'active' parameters indicate whether the job is executed or not. Set them
all to true to run everything).
