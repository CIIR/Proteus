This is to hold some information concerning the manual process I'm going through
to get the pipeline working:

phokas:

- You need to install 'leiningen' version 2:
  https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/
 
  Until homebrew and apt-get are updated, I recommend manual installation for
  the time being. It's not hard:
  https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/#installation

- A quick protip: 
  Put '{:user {:plugins [[lein-localrepo "0.4.0"]]}}' in
  '~/.lein/profiles.clj'. It should install a local repo
  scanner, meaning 'lein localrepo list' will show you
  what lein can see. You may need that to make sure you
  get the Maven coordinates right.

- Until we get these up on a repo, you need to pull a few jars and install them
  locally so lein can find them. They're scattered on the various UMass clusters,
  so you'll need to ask one of the team members for the downloads directly.
  These total about 700MB, so make sure you have room to support that.
  The Maven coordinates (<groupId>.<artifactId>.<version>) for the installed 
  files are:
      - dparser.dparser.2011-01-18
      - stanford-corenlp.stanford-corenlp.2010-11-12
      - ciir.nlp-models.pom.2011-07-12

- There are also some "dep" files that need to be pulled down, which are used in
  language determination (I think). They're not packaged, so again you need to ask
  for them and stick them somewhere local:
      - fre.dep
      - ger.dep
      - german.dep
      - ita.dep
      - lat.dep   
      - ger.pos
      - lat.pos 

Those last two may not be needed, but they're not big and couldn't hurt, from 
what I can tell.

- core.clj in Phokas has at least 1 hardcoded directory. You'll need to update it.

- And now I'm at the point of get some weird exceptions:
#<ClassCastException java.lang.ClassCastException: clojure.data.xml.Event cannot be cast to clojure.lang.IFn>

so for now I'm stopping with this.
