Required: sbt 0.11.2

enter sbt console
run "scrooge-gen"
run "gen-idea" (if you want to use intellij, there are plugins for netbeans and eclipse out there too)

Note: If you are using Intellij (recommended) and run a scrooge-gen, I think you will always have to follow with the gen-idea command so that Intellij is aware of compilation changes.
