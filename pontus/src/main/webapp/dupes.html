            This page shows the partial duplicates of the searched (reference) book. A partial duplicate means that the
content of the two books may overlap partly or completely.  Each figure shows a duplicate pair.
Each box  is a linear representation of a book.  Green indicates where the books overlap while
red indicates no overlap. The relative lengths of the two books are indicated by the lengths of the boxes.
The text alongside each box identifies which is the the original or reference
 and the title alongside the other box identifies the corresponding duplicate.
