    <p>
      The settings can be accessed via gear icon on the top right of the main search page or directly via the <span class="my-pre">settings.html</span> page e.g.:<br>
      <span class="my-pre">http://bulgroo.cs.umass.edu:1234/settings.html</span><br>
      Here you can adjust settings and add labels.

 <h2>Result Options</h2>
    <p>There are several options that affect how the search results are displayed:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Number of entities : How many of each entity type (if available) to display for each document.</li>
      <li>Auto show duplicates : When checked, duplicate documents will be visible. If unchecked, you have to click the "Show Duplicates" link under a document to see them.</li>
      <li>Auto show notes : When checked, any notes for a document will be show in the results.</li>
      <li>Show found with queries : When checked, if a user applied a label to the document, the query that was used to find this document will be shown.</li>
      <li>Show single terms in query builder : When checked, single terms will be shown in the query builder.</li>
      <li>Allow query builder : When checked, the query builder link will be displayed when appropriate.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: these options are per user.</p>

    <h2>Labels</h2>
    <p>This is where you can create or modify the labels that show under documents. You may need to refresh the main search page to see any changes. Currently, labels can not be deleted. Anyone with access to that instance of Proteus will see these labels.</p>
