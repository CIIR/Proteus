
  <h1>Activity Monitor</h1>
  <p>
    The activity monitor allows you to see what people are doing in Proteus in real time.
</p>
    <h2>Port</h2>
<p>
  The activity monitor listens on the boadcast port sepcified in the <a href="index.html?topic=config">configuration parameters</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You can override that port - to view the activity of another Proteus instance - by specifing the port on the URL. e.g.:<br>
  <span class="my-pre">http://bulgroo.cs.umass.edu:1234/activity.html?port=2332</span>
</p>
